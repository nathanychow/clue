2. Step 2 - Pick your opponent's characters.
 - It is important that you do this in order clock-wise from your position (assuming that the order of play
 will be clock-wise).
 - Enter a number one at a time until all opponents characters have been set.  Then enter 1 to signify that you
 are done.
 
3. Step 3 - Enter the cards that you hold/any face-up cards.
 - Again, do this one at a time, entering 1. any time you are done a category of cards.
 - Once you enter 1. signifying the end of room cards, you will be taken to the running game menu.

 - it will then direct you to enter which card that player showed you.
 
2. Option 2 - 'Another player is making a suggestion'
 - select this when another player is inquiring about cards.
 - you will be first asked which player is asking.
 - next, which cards they are asking about.
 - next, who showed card.
 
3. Option 3 - 'Show me seen cards'
 - this option will show you all the cards that you have seen. (i.e. cards you know cannot be in the envelope).
 
4. Option 4 - 'Show me what's left'
 - this option will show you all cards that you have not seen yet. (i.e. do not know with 100% certainty that someone
 is holding these cards).

5. Option 5 - 'Should I make an accusation?'
 - this will say Yes and list the cards to accuse if there are only 1 of each category left unseen.
 - otherwise it wills say not yet.
 
DEDUCTIONS

In addition to marking cards as seen when we make a suggestion (and thus literally see it)

We will mark a card as seen when:
-- if P1 asks about cards A, B, C.  P2 shows a card.  However we know that cards A and B are not in P2's hand.
-- Then we will mark C as seen and that P2 has it.
