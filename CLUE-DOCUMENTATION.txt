 - It is important that you do this in order clock-wise from your position (assuming that the order of play
 will be clock-wise).
 - Enter a number one at a time until all opponents characters have been set.  Then enter 1 to signify that you
 are done.
 
3. Step 3 - Enter the cards that you hold/any face-up cards.
 - Again, do this one at a time, entering 1. any time you are done a category of cards.

 - you will be first asked which player is asking.
 - next, which cards they are asking about.
 - next, who showed card.
 
3. Option 3 - 'Show me seen cards'
 - this option will show you all the cards that you have seen. (i.e. cards you know cannot be in the envelope).
 
4. Option 4 - 'Show me what's left'
 - this option will show you all cards that you have not seen yet. (i.e. do not know with 100% certainty that someone is holding these cards).
- Note: it will also include cards you know are in the envelope in this list

5. Option 5 - 'Should I make an accusation?'
 - this will say Yes and list the cards to accuse if there are only 1 of each category left unseen.

DEDUCTIONS

- Program keeps track of what a player has, what a player doesn’t have, and suggestions
that we aren’t sure which card was shown.

When a suggestion is made (either ours or another players)
- P1 asks and P2 shows a card
- Players between P1 and P2 are marked as not having the suggested cards
- If we know P2 has a card then we stop, 
     otherwise we filter out suggested cards that we know P2 doesn’t have
- If there is one card remaining, then P2 must have that card. Otherwise we store suggestion.



After every suggestion made:
- go through list of suggestions and see if we can figure out which card was shown
- go through all players and see if there are any players we know all the cards for
      - then we can say they don’t have rest of the cards
- go through all players, determine which ones have enough cards we know they don’t have
      - then we can say they have rest of the cards
- go through all remaining cards and determine if we know which player it belongs to
- go through all facts to determine which cards are in the envelope
